    <title>Five W's of Data</title>

    <p>Statistics show up in research papers, articles, and the daily news. They are used in nursing, business, biology, and mathematics. In fact, they are somewhat unavoidable. Phrases like <q>that was unexpected</q> and <q>what are the odds?</q> have become commonplace, while games like Monopoly, Yahtzee, and the Lottery<fn>This seems to exist <em>only</em> because of a gross misunderstanding of statistics</fn> are all based around probability and statistics.</p>

    <p>Together, we will build a basic understanding of Statistics. We will learn about data, probability, survey methods, the <xref provisional="theorem-CLM"/> Central Limit Theorem, confidence intervals, and least-square lines (among other topics). In my opinion, the most important of these goals is making conclusions about a population based on sample data. In order to do this, however, we must first answer the simplest question possible: What is data?</p>

        <title>What are Data?</title>

            <p>Our goal for this unit is to analyze data<fn>The word <q>data</q> is plural and a single piece of data is called <q>datum</q>.</fn> numerically and to display it using various graphs and tables (<eg/> Pie Chart and Frequency Table). Describing data is a bit like describing a painting<ndash/>there's more than one way to look at it. While we will have a certain method for approaching things, feel free to get creative and take risks!</p>
