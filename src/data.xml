	<p>It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data.</p>

        <p>Statistics show up in research papers, articles, and the daily news. They are used in nursing, business, biology, and mathematics. In fact, they are somewhat unavoidable. Phrases like <q>that was unexpected</q> and <q>what are the odds?</q> have become commonplace, while games like Monopoly, Yahtzee, and the Lottery<fn>This seems to exist <em>only</em> because of a gross misunderstanding of statistics</fn> are all based around probability and statistics.</p>

    <p>Together, we will build a basic understanding of Statistics. We will learn about data, probability, survey methods, the <xref provisional="theorem-CLM"/> Central Limit Theorem, confidence intervals, and least-square lines (among other topics). In my opinion, the most important of these goals is making conclusions about a population based on sample data. In order to do this, however, we must first answer the simplest, and yet most complex, question possible: What are data?</p>
