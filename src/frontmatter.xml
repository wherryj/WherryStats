		<p>In 2015, Alex Jordan converted the lab manual to MathBook XML (enabling the HTML output alongside a PDF) with some support from PCC's professional development grants.</p>
                <p>Phil Thurber and Scot Leavitt created the cover composition using images provided by NASA, the Bodleian Library of the University of Oxford, and PCC instructor Ken Kidoguchi.</p>

            <title>To All</title>
            <p>Calculus I is taught at Portland Community College using a lecture/lab format. The laboratory time is set aside for students to investigate the topics and practice the skills that are covered during their lecture periods. This lab manual serves as a guide for the laboratory component of the course.</p>

            <section number="no"><title>HTML and PDF</title>
            <p>This manual has been released with several synchronous versions that offer different features. The essential content of each version is the same as for all others.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><p>A web version is available at <url href="http://spot.pcc.edu/math/clm"/>. Whenever there is an internet connection, and you do not prefer to have a print copy, this version is most recommended. The web version offers full walk-through solutions to supplemental problems. More importantly, it offers interactive elements and easier navigation than any of the PDFs below could offer.</p></li>
                <li><p>A <q>for-printing</q> PDF is available at <url href="http://spot.pcc.edu/math/clm/clm-print.pdf"/>. This version is designed to be printed, not read on a screen. To save on printing expense, this version is mostly black-and-white, and only offers short answers to the supplemental exercises (as opposed to full solutions).</p></li>
                <li><p>A <q>for-printing-with-color</q> PDF is available at <url href="http://spot.pcc.edu/math/clm/clm-print-color.pdf"/>. This version is like the above, except links and graphs retain their color.</p></li>
                <li><p>A <q>for-screen-reading</q> PDF is available at <url href="http://spot.pcc.edu/math/clm/clm-screen.pdf"/>. This version is intended to be stored on an electronic device and read when an internet connection is unavailable. It has page dimensions compatible with most laptops and tablets. The pages are not numbered since the page numbering would be inconsistent with the print versions, so this version should be navigated by section numbering. Because the page dimensions are customized for electronic devices, this version would also look strange printed on standard paper. Since this version is not intended to be printed, full solutions to the supplemental problems are offered. Keep in mind that even if you store this PDF version on your electronic device, when an internet connection is available, you might opt to use the HTML version instead, as that version has more interactive and accessible functionality than the PDF version.</p></li>
            </ul>

            <section number="no"><title>Copying Content</title>
            <p>The graphs and other images that appear in this manual may be copied in various file formats using the HTML version. Below each image are links to <c>.png</c>, <c>.eps</c>, <c>.svg</c>, <c>.pdf</c>, and <c>.tex</c> files that contain the image. The <c>.eps</c>, <c>.svg</c>, and <c>.pdf</c> files will not lose sharpness no matter how much you zoom, but typically are large files. Some of these formats may not be recognized by applications that you use. The <c>.png</c> file are of fairly high resolution, but will eventually lose sharpness if you zoom in too much. The <c>.tex</c> files contain code that can be inserted into other <c>.tex</c> documents to re-create the images.</p> 

            <p>Similarly, tables can be copied from the HTML version and pasted into applications like MS Word. However, mathematical content within tables will not always paste correctly without a little extra effort as described below.</p>

            <p>Mathematical content can be copied from the HTML version. To copy math content into MS Word, right-click or control-click over the math content, and click to Show Math As MathML Code. Copy the resulting code, and Paste <em>Special</em> into Word. In the Paste Special menu, paste it as Unformatted Text. To copy math content into <latex/> source, right-click or control-click over the math content, and click to Show Math As TeX Commands.</p>
            </section>

            <section number="no"><title>Accessibility</title>
            <p>The HTML version is intended to meet or exceed all web accessibility standards. If you encounter an accessibility issue, please report it to the editor.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><p>All graphs and images should have meaningful alt text that communicates what a sighted person would see, without necessarily giving away anything that is intended to be deduced from the image.</p></li>
                <li><p>All math content is rendered using MathJax. MathJax has a contextual menu that can be accessed in several ways, depending on what operating system and browser you are using. The most common way is to right-click or control-click on some piece of math content.</p></li>
                <li><p>In the MathJax contextual menu, you may set options for triggering a zoom effect on math content, and also by what factor the zoom will be.</p></li>
                <li><p>If you change the MathJax renderer to MathML, then a screen reader will generally have success verbalizing the math content.</p></li>
            </ul>
            </section>

            <section number="no"><title>Tablets and Smartphones</title>
            <p>MathBook XML documents like this lab manual are <q>mobile-friendly</q>. The display adapts to whatever screen size or window size you are using. A math teacher will always recommend that you do not study from the small screen on a phone, but if it's necessary, this manual gives you that option.</p>
